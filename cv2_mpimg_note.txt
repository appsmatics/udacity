Image Handling:

matplotlib
- png images will be read on a scale of 0 to 1 !
- Jpeg images on a scale 0-255 !

cv2
- cv2.imread() will scale them from 0 to 255. 
- cv2.resize and cv2.cvtColor may change the scaling of the image back to [0, 255].


If you are testing your pipeline on .jpg images remember to scale them accordingly. 
So just be sure to be consistent between your training data features and inference features!
