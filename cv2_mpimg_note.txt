Make sure your images are scaled correctly
The training dataset provided for this project ( vehicle and non-vehicle images) are in the .png format. Somewhat confusingly, matplotlib image will read these in on a scale of 0 to 1, but cv2.imread() will scale them from 0 to 255. Be sure if you are switching between cv2.imread() and matplotlib image for reading images that you scale them appropriately! Otherwise your feature vectors can get screwed up.

To add to the confusion, matplotlib image will read .jpg images in on a scale of 0 to 255 so if you are testing your pipeline on .jpg images remember to scale them accordingly. And if you take an image that is scaled from 0 to 1 and change color spaces using cv2.cvtColor() you'll get back an image scaled from 0 to 255. So just be sure to be consistent between your training data features and inference features!

Keep in mind that operations like cv2.resize and cv2.cvtColor may change the scaling of the image back to [0, 255].
